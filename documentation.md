**Documentation of activities & observations during the Fab Zero program**

*Download and install  **"Visual Studio Code"** along with **Code Spell Checker***



The daily activities that were recorded in notebooks were typed using "Visual Studio Code" and save it as a markdown file, I have recorded the activities of day one and save it as **day1.md** and uploaded it in the Repository folder of the github page. It was observed that my page was not displayed correctly in the website, latter,it was realised that   the file should be **readme.md**, so my day 1 entry is now renamed as "readme.md" 
For ease of working, it is required that a local copy or clone of the uploaded files in Github is created using the following steps.
1. Open Visual Studio Code programme
2. press **Ctrl+Shift+P**
3. type **git: clone** (better to select the syntax from drop down list), press Enter
4. Open a new window, sign in or open  github page and find the "Clone and download" button, and copy the web link of my page from there
5. go to the Visual Studio code program again and paste the page link in the space where  the "git: clone" command was given, then specify a local folder for storing the files.  
! not working ??? if you are working on Windows operating system, download and install **Git for windows** , then restart Visual Studio Basic and try step 2 to step 5 again. (works for me that way)
Now i have a backup of my page in a local folder, the files can now be assessed offline also and edit them using Visual Studio Code before uploading the files to the Github page.


**Steps for editing Github page**
1. Open Visual Studio Code, then select and open the file you want to edit 
2. During and after the editing dont forget to save the changes (Ctrl +S), then  click on the "Source Control" button on the left hand side or press (Ctrl + Shift +G)
3. then type a relevant meaningful message regarding the change in the "message box" i have typed 19th March 2019 and then 
4. click on the **commit button** above which is denoted by a "tick sign"
5. The last step to update the page for the Github web is to **push**, for this click on the "button with three dots" and select **push** from drop down menu. 

**To insert images on the Github pages**
1. select pictures to upload
2. to make sure the images are resized to either 800X600 or 600X800 pixels and are renamed suitably
3. click **explorer** button or Ctrl+ Shift+ E
4. when the cursor is moved over the folder name on the top left side of page  (the folder where the offline pages are stored in the local drive) some pop up icons appear, have to select the **New Folder** button and rename it as **img**
5. the images to be uploaded has to be dumped to this **img** folder by any means, even drag and drop works
6. Bring curser to the desired location within the text and type **![description of the image](file name.extension)**
7. to effect the changes in the Github page follow step 3 to step 5 of previous paragraph.

Have successfully inserted a picture of the Large format CNC Alpha (96X48) ny ShopBot in my day 1 page, using the above steps. more to follow.

Also download **Gitbash** software and update email address and user name by giving the following commands
**git config --global user.email "motilal.sarma@stpi.in"**
**git config --global user.name "Motilals""**
