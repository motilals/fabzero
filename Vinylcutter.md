Hands on for the Vinyl cutter will be done tommorow,
 learned loading the vinyl by adjusting the roller,  for accessibility of maximum area on the vinyl,since the position of two rollers will fix the margin of the cutting head. 

The maximum width of vinyl roll is 62 cms.

Care should be taken to align the vinyl roll parallel to the alignment markings on the cutter.
The rollers can be placed only at the points where there are white markings on the guide 

Further, the rollers can be places at the edge of the vinyl roll by leaving atleast 2mm on both sides
