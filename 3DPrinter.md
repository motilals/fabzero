This printer uses Polylactic acid filament (PLA) for printing objects with different colours, however only a single colour printing can be done at a time 
The filament is 1.75mm in diameter and a cartridge can hold 700 gram of filament
The filament has to be tightly wound, inside the cartridge.
Filament should be handled with care so as not to stressed or bend it to avoid even slight deformities in the filament, any part with deformities may be cut off before feeding inside the printer.

The loose ends of the filament should not extrude from the opening of cartridge.

After new filament cartridge is fitted manually inside the printer, the feed new cartridge command can be assessed by selecting the **Cartridge** menu on lcd screen available in the printer 
(As seen in picture)

a few design files for 3d printing are readily available in the website like **thingiverse.com** for testing, we can create our own designs for printing by using free software like **Curo**

Due to constrain of time, we download a design file for creating a Clip which can be use to prevent unwinding of 1.75mm PLA filament inside the cartridge.

The base substrade had to be removed manually, some bigger designs can be printed without the base.

The printer that we have used is wi fi enabled and the print command can be issued from any pc in the network by using the software provided by the manufacturer or alternatively by transfering the sliced file in G-code format directly to the printer by using a USB memory stick and use the print command from the lcd menu of the printer.

The base plate may get heated up by around 60 degree centigrade, so care should be taken while removing it.

Also, the debri collection chamber inside the printer need to be emptied on regular intervals.
