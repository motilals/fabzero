Fabzero program is being organised at the Elite building of STPI Bhubaneshwar from 18th March 2019 to 5th April 2019.
The program is being attended by technical team from STPI centres across the country. 
The trainees are being mentored by Mr Francisco from Spain, Barcelona and Mr. Sibu from Kochi. The team of experts from Fab Academy has setup various Fab labs and have conducted numerous training programs across India and abroad.


After the launch of the training program by the Director General of Software Technology Parks of India through video conferencing, the Fabzero at STPI Bubhaneswar kick started. 
It is learned that STPI is ready to setup new Fablabs across the country if the respective State Government is ready to contribute 50% of the installation cost.

The aim of setting up of Fab lab is to expose people from all walks of life such as Startup entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, students, artists and interested people, to the possibilities of digital fabrication techniques.
One of the aim of Digital fabrication is also to reduce wastage of used articles, if we can create objects of everyday use which can be reassembled into multiple objects.
Fabzero is a precursor to the 6 months diploma program of Fablab. Hoping to learn to make (almost) everything at the Fablab during this session.

**Responsibility of the user of Fablab**
To follow all safety instructions 2. At the end of the day, leave the laboratory  and the equipments (clean) just the way you found it 3. To document your experience at the Lab so that others might find it useful.

**Documentation of activities & observations**

Download and install  **"Visual Studio Code"** and after that we install **Code Spell Checker**

We also download and install **"Inkscape"** which is a 2D graphics design software along with **"Cura"** a software used for 3D Printing design. These are all free softwares. 

The daily activities that were recorded in the notebooks were typed using "Visual Studio Code" and save it as a markdown file, I have recorded the activities of day one and save it as **day1.md** and uploaded it in the Repository folder of the github page. It was observed that my page was not displayed correctly in the website, latter,it was realised that   the file should be **readme.md**, so my day 1 entry is now renamed as "readme.md" 
For ease of working, it is required that a local copy or clone of the uploaded files in Github is created using the following steps.
1. Open Visual Studio Code programme
2. press **Ctrl+Shift+P**
3. type **git: clone** (better to select the syntax from drop down list), press Enter
4. Open a new window, sign in or open  github page and find the "Clone and download" button, and copy the web link of my page from there
5. go to the Visual Studio code program again and paste the page link in the space where  the "git: clone" command was given, then specify a local folder for storing the files.  
! not working ??? if you are working on Windows operating system, download and install **Git for windows** , then restart Visual Studio Basic and try step 2 to step 5 again. (works for me that way)
Now i have a backup of my page in a local folder, the files can now be assessed offline also and edit them using Visual Studio Code before uploading the files to the Github page.


**Steps for editing Github page**
1. Open Visual Studio Code, then select and open the file you want to edit 
2. During and after the editing dont forget to save the changes (Ctrl +S), then  click on the "Source Control" button on the left hand side or press (Ctrl + Shift +G)
3. then type a relevant meaningful message regarding the change in the "message box" i have typed 19th March 2019 and then 
4. click on the **commit button** above which is denoted by a "tick sign"
5. The last step to update the page for the Github web is to **push**, for this click on the "button with three dots" and select **push** from drop down menu. 

**To insert images on the Github pages**
1. select pictures to upload
2. to make sure the images are resized to either 800X600 or 600X800 pixels and are renamed suitably
3. click **explorer** button or Ctrl+ Shift+ E
4. when the cursor is moved over the folder name on the top left side of page  (the folder where the offline pages are stored in the local drive) some pop up icons appear, have to select the **New Folder** button and rename it as **img**
5. the images to be uploaded has to be dumped to this **img** folder by any means, even drag and drop works
6. Bring curser to the desired location within the text and type **![description of the image](file name.extension)**
7. to effect the changes in the Github page follow step 3 to step 5 of previous paragraph.

Have successfully inserted a picture of the Large format CNC Alpha (96X48) ny ShopBot in my day 1 page, using the above steps. more to follow.

Also download **Gitbash** software and update email address and user name by giving the following commands
**git config --global user.email "motilal.sarma@stpi.in"**
**git config --global user.name "Motilals""**
