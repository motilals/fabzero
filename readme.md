Fabzero program is being organised at the Elite building of STPI Bhubaneswar from 18th March 2019 to 5th April 2019.
The program is being attended by technical team from STPI centres across the country. 
The trainees are being mentored by Mr Francisco from Spain, Barcelona and Mr. Sibu from Kochi. The team of experts from Fab Academy has setup various Fab labs and have conducted numerous training programs across India and abroad. Mr Fransisco also started Beach Lab, a mobile research and development Fab Lab in Digital fabrication and Synthetic biology.


After the launch of the training program by the Director General of Software Technology Parks of India through video conferencing, the Fabzero at STPI Bhubaneswar kick started. 
It is now possible that STPI will setup new Fablabs across the country with the cooperation of  respective State Government.
Digital fabrication is considered as the third revolution that will create transformation in the society with more impact then the  Internet and mobile communication systems has in the past. 

The aim of setting up of Fab lab is to expose people from all walks of life such as Startup entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, students, artists and all interested people, to the various possibilities of digital fabrication techniques in creating a sustainable future through collaborative innovation.

Fabzero program is a precursor to the 6 months diploma program of Fablab. Hoping to learn to make (almost) everything at the Fablab during this session.
