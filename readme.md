FabZero program is being organised at the Elite building of Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), Bhubaneswar, India from 18th March 2019 to 5th April 2019.
The program is attended by technical teams from STPI centres across the country. 
The trainees are being mentored by Francisco Sanchez and Sibu Saman. The team of experts from Fab Academy has vast experience in setting up  Fab labs and have conducted many training programs across India and abroad. Mr Sanchez also started **Beach Lab**, a mobile research and development Fab Lab in Digital fabrication and Synthetic biology.


After the launch of the FabZero, Bhubaneswar  by Dr. Omkar Rai,  Director General, Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) through video conferencing, the session kick started. It is heartening to know the possibility of STPI setting up new Fablabs across the country with the cooperation of  respective State Government.

Digital fabrication is considered as the third revolution that will create transformation in the society with more impact then the  Internet and mobile communication systems had in the past. 
The aim of setting up of Fab lab is to expose people from all walks of life such as startup entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, students, artists and all interested people, to the various possibilities of digital fabrication techniques in creating a sustainable future through collaborative innovation.

Fabzero program is a precursor to the 6 months diploma program of Fablab Academy. Hoping to learn to make (almost) everything at the Fablab during this session.
